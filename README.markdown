# ðŸ§Š kado ã‚«ãƒ‰: Cofibrations in Cartesian Cubical Type Theory

This library implements cofibrations in Cartesian cubical type theory as described in the paper [Syntax and models of Cartesian cubical type theory,](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0960129521000347) with the following two extensions:

1. Cofibration variables.
2. Inequalities between dimension variables. The equation `a = b` is understood as `a <= b && b >= a`.

## Stability

âš  The API is experimental and unstable. We will break things!
